IOIOPlotter
===========

Source code for my IOIO Plotter. The design is a simple easel-mounted wall-style plotter.
A marker is suspended by two strings, each is rolled on spool, which is driven by a stepper motor.
The entire setup is controlled by an Android tablet through a IOIO board.
The app in this repo allows converting photos (from the camera or gallery) into artistic vector drawings and immediately
execute them on the plotter.
